# Olympic Games Data Analysis

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a Jupyter notebook showcasing a comprehensive analysis of Olympic Games data. The project covers various aspects, including data import, merging, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and visualization. The goal is to provide insights into the performance of countries in the Olympic Games and explore potential relationships with socio-economic factors.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Import and Merging**: Importing and merging datasets related to summer and winter Olympic Games, as well as a country code dictionary.

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, renaming columns, and converting data types for consistency.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the top 10 countries by total medals, analyzing medal distribution, and exploring correlations with socio-economic factors.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducting Spearman correlation tests to analyze relationships between total medals and factors like population, GDP, and total games participation.

- **Aggregating and Ranking**: Creating heatmaps to show the ranks of the top 50 countries by various factors, including total medals, summer/winter games, and men/women success.

- **Geographical and Cultural Analysis**: Using heatmaps to explore the success of countries in both summer and winter games, as well as analyzing the performance of men vs. women.

- **Sports Traditions Exploration**: Identifying traditional sports for specific countries based on their ranks in different sports.

- **Documentation**: Well-documented code with detailed markdown explanations for clarity and transparency.
